## Overview

This project implements GraphRAG, an advanced retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages graph databases and knowledge graphs to enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of AI-generated responses. Unlike traditional RAG systems that rely solely on vector similarity, GraphRAG incorporates:

- **Graph-structured knowledge representation** for capturing complex relationships
- **Multi-hop reasoning** across connected entities
- **Contextual retrieval** based on graph traversal and semantic similarity
- **Enhanced generation** through structured knowledge integration

### Key Benefits

- **Improved accuracy**: Graph relationships provide better context for information retrieval
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Ability to connect distant but related concepts
- **Explainable results**: Clear traceability through graph paths
- **Scalable architecture**: Efficient handling of large knowledge graphs

## Features

- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Automatic entity extraction and relationship mapping
- **Graph-Enhanced Retrieval**: Intelligent traversal of knowledge graphs for relevant information
- **LLM Integration**: Seamless integration with popular language models (GPT, Groq, etc.)
- **Hybrid Search**: Combination of vector similarity and graph-based retrieval
- **Interactive Queries**: Support for complex, multi-part questions
- **Visualization**: Graph visualization capabilities for better understanding

## Architecture

```
User Query → Query Processing → Graph Traversal → Context Assembly → LLM Generation → Response
